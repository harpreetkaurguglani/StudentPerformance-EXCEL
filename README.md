## Regression Analysis

multiple R: The measure of Correlation coefficient. The value of 81% plies that the 81% of variance in the math score variable can be explained by the reading score of the student.															
R^2: Value of 67% of the variation in the math score can be explained by the variation in the reading score.									
SS Residuals: This value is identifying the variation of the actual dispersion of modeling error which is high is our case.										
p-value:P<0.05 indicates that the slope is not zero. In this regression the p-value is much much lower than 0.05 significance level. This leads us to conclude that the slope of line is not zero. We can conclue, predictor variable are associated with changes in the response variable.									

## Summary:							
The average for students in all the subject score is highest for the parents with masters level of degree whereas it is lowest for the parents with just high school level of education. The highest scored average considering the individual level is for the writing subject under the masters degree parental. With the increase in the level of education among the parents the score`s average is increasing for all the courses indicating that the parental education level does impact the student`s performance. The highest scored average considering the overall levels is for the maths subject.
It can be also observed that the males(using filter) have better average score than females in the maths subject. Female students have much higher average than males for the other subjects - reading and writing score. All the average scores are above 50%average. Indicating students give there best perform and level of parenting only impacts to let them stand out of the average level.

The highest average from the total test prep completion is for the writing subject as compared to the other subjects. Whereas lowest been for the math subject. It seems writing subject prep is most popular among student. It seems strange that even though the math average score for the parental level of masters was high the test prep completion is not good. It is much lower than for the students with parental level of some college degree. On an average 64% of the students are the once who have not completed the test prep for math subject with lowest been from the students with high school level of parenting which is a good indicator. It can be concluded that on an average more than 60% of the students have completed the test prep for all the courses.
